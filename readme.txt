A starter theme called J-Bones, or underscores.

== Description ==

Custom WordPress theme with a simple design for easy modification, and many pre-built features.
I built this theme with the intent of using it as the base of multiple different websites that I could easily modify with child themes. I kept the design simple yet modern so there wouldn't be too much CSS to modify, yet powerful enough to make quick renditions from the start of a project.

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
